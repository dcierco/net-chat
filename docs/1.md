# High-Level Design and Requirements

## System Architecture

### Overview
The chat application is designed as a client-server model with two main components:

1. **Client Module**: 
    - Interprets user commands.
    - Communicates with the server.
    - Displays messages to the user.

2. **Server Module**:
    - Manages client connections and user registration.
    - Facilitates 1:1 communication.
    - Supports both text messages and file transfers via TCP and UDP.

### Communication Protocols

- **TCP/IPv4**: 
  - Used for reliable communication, especially for user registration, authentication, and text messaging.
  - Ensures message ordering and integrity.

- **UDP/IPv4**:
  - Used for faster, smaller data transfers (e.g., real-time communication updates).
  - May involve custom packet loss handling and retransmission for file transfers.

### Design Patterns

- **Multithreaded Server Model**: 
  - Utilizes Rust's threading capabilities to handle multiple client connections simultaneously.
  - Employ `tokio` for asynchronous I/O operations to improve scalability and efficiency.

- **Event-driven Model**:
  - Events triggered by client commands (send message, send file) handled asynchronously.

Client A --|
           |--(TCP/UDP)-- Server --(TCP/UDP)-- Client B
Client N --|
```

1. **Client-Server Interaction**:
   - Clients send requests to the server, which handles routing and management of connections.

2. **Protocol Handling**:
   - Separate handling for TCP and UDP, with mechanisms for reliable messaging and quick updates.

## Design Decisions

### Rust Features Utilization

- **Concurrency with `tokio`**:
  - Efficient async programming model.
  - Use of `async`/`await` syntax allows non-blocking operations.

- **Memory Safety**:
  - Ownership and borrowing prevent race conditions.
  - Rust’s safety guarantees help in writing concurrent code without data races.

### Protocol Justification

- **TCP for Reliability**:
  - Guarantees delivery, essential for messaging and ensuring data order.

- **UDP for Speed**:
  - Suited for low-latency updates. For file transfers, implement an acknowledgment protocol to ensure data integrity.

## Pseudocode Snippets

### Client Module
```rust
async fn client_main() {
    let mut tcp_stream = TcpStream::connect("server_address").await?;
    let mut udp_socket = UdpSocket::bind("client_address").await?;
    udp_socket.connect("server_address").await?;

    loop {
        match get_user_input() {
            Command::SendMessage(msg) => tcp_stream.write_all(msg).await,
            Command::SendFile(file_path) => send_file(file_path, &udp_socket).await,
            // Handle more commands...
        }
    }
}
```

### Server Module
```rust
async fn handle_client(tcp_stream: TcpStream, udp_socket: UdpSocket) {
    // Handle TCP messages for commands
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        loop {
            let message = read_from_tcp(&mut tcp_stream).await;
            // Process message...
        }
    });

    // Handle UDP messages for fast updates or file data
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        loop {
            let packet = read_from_udp(&mut udp_socket).await;
            // Process packet...
        }
    });
}
```

## Documentation

- **TCP for text communication**: Ensures ordered messages with retries on failure, good for reliability.
- **UDP for file transfer**: Faster, benefits from custom reliability layer (e.g., ACK packets).
- **Async Model in Rust**: `tokio` provides efficient handling of async I/O without needing manual thread management, leveraging Rust’s strengths in safety.

By using these Rust features, we ensure robust handling of concurrency while maintaining high performance and responsiveness.

With this architectural design, developers can effectively manage the application, implement further features, and ensure smooth client-server interactions in a Rust-based chat application.
