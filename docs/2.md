# Client-Server Communication Protocol Design

## Protocol Overview

The client-server communication protocol is designed for efficient handling of user registration, message exchange, and text file transfers. It is influenced by established protocols like HTTP for its request-response pattern and DNS for its compact message format.

## Message Types and Structure

### 1. REGISTER

- **Purpose**: User registration and authentication.
  
- **Structure**:
  - `Type`: REGISTER
  - `Username`: String
  - `Password`: String (hashed)

- **Usage Example**:
  ```plaintext
  REGISTER|john_doe|hashed_password123
  ```

- **Response**:
  - `Status`: SUCCESS or FAILURE
  - `Reason`: String (if failure)

### 2. MESSAGE

- **Purpose**: Sending text messages between users.

- **Structure**:
  - `Type`: MESSAGE
  - `From`: String (sender username)
  - `To`: String (receiver username)
  - `Content`: String (message body)

- **Usage Example**:
  ```plaintext
  MESSAGE|john_doe|jane_doe|Hello, Jane!
  ```

- **Response**:
  - `Status`: DELIVERED or FAILURE
  - `Reason`: String (if failure)

### 3. FILE_TRANSFER

- **Purpose**: Transfer text files between users using either TCP or UDP.

- **Structure**:
  - `Type`: FILE_TRANSFER
  - `From`: String (sender username)
  - `To`: String (receiver username)
  - `Filename`: String
  - `Packet_Number`: Integer
  - `Total_Packets`: Integer
  - `Data`: Binary (file content)

- **Usage Example** (over UDP):
  ```plaintext
  FILE_TRANSFER|john_doe|jane_doe|example.txt|1|10|<binary_data>
  ```

- **Response** (acknowledgments for each packet):
  - `ACK|Packet_Number`
  - `Status`: RECEIVED or FAILURE

## Error Handling

- **Malformed Messages**: 
  - Response with `ERROR` type and reason.
  - Example: `ERROR|Malformed message format.`

- **Registration Errors**:
  - Example: `REGISTER|FAILURE|Username already taken.`

- **Delivery Errors**:
  - Example: `MESSAGE|FAILURE|User not online.`

- **File Transfer Errors**:
  - Retry mechanism for dropped packets over UDP.
  - Response: `FILE_TRANSFER|FAILURE|Packet error: <reason>.`

## Control Mechanisms

- **Acknowledge Mechanisms**:
  - TCP handles acknowledgment inherently.
  - UDP requires explicit acknowledgment for each packet (ACK message).

- **Flow Control**:
  - Manage data flow to prevent congestion and ensure orderly communication during file transfers.

## Sequence Diagrams

### Message Sending and Receiving

```plaintext
Client -> Server: MESSAGE|john_doe|jane_doe|Hello!
Server -> Receiver Client: MESSAGE|john_doe|jane_doe|Hello!
Server <- Receiver Client: MESSAGE|DELIVERED
Client <- Server: MESSAGE|DELIVERED
```

### File Transfer with Acknowledgment

```plaintext
Client -> Server: FILE_TRANSFER|Send|example.txt
Server -> Receiver Client: Prepare file reception
Client -> Server: FILE_TRANSFER|1|10|<binary_data>
Server -> Receiver Client: Forward packet 1
Server <- Receiver Client: ACK|1
```

## Design Rationale

- **Simplified Parsing**:
  - Messages use a delimiter (`|`) for easy parsing.
  
- **Statelessness**:
  - Inspired by HTTP, ensuring each request contains all necessary information.

- **Error Reporting**:
  - Detailed error messages enhance debugging and usability.

- **Extensibility**:
  - New message types can be added as needed, maintaining backward compatibility.

By structuring the protocol with these considerations, the design supports robust communication in a Rust-based chat application, effectively managing both text and file exchanges over TCP and UDP.
