# File Transfer Protocol Development

## Overview

This section outlines the development of a file transfer system for the chat application, focusing on packetization, transmission, reassembly, and error handling. Rust's features are leveraged for safety and performance.

## Design Process

### 1. Packetization

- Files are split into manageable chunks.
- Each packet contains:
  - `Header`: Includes metadata (e.g., packet number, total packets).
  - `Data`: A portion of the file's binary content.

### 2. Transmission

- **TCP**: 
  - Entire file sent sequentially, benefiting from built-in reliability and order.
- **UDP**: 
  - Individual packets sent without inherent order or error checking; requires custom handling.

### 3. Reassembly

- Packets are reassembled into the original file upon arrival.
- Missing packets are re-requested in UDP implementations.

## Code Snippets

### TCP File Transfer

```rust
use tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt};
use tokio::fs::File;
use tokio::net::TcpStream;

async fn send_file_tcp(mut stream: TcpStream, file_path: &str) -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let mut file = File::open(file_path).await?;
    let mut buffer = Vec::new();

    file.read_to_end(&mut buffer).await?;
    stream.write_all(&buffer).await?;
    Ok(())
}

async fn receive_file_tcp(mut stream: TcpStream, file_path: &str) -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let mut file = File::create(file_path).await?;
    let mut buffer = vec![0; 1024];

    loop {
        let n = stream.read(&mut buffer).await?;
        if n == 0 { break; }
        file.write_all(&buffer[..n]).await?;
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

### UDP File Transfer

```rust
use tokio::net::UdpSocket;

async fn send_file_udp(socket: UdpSocket, addr: &str, file_path: &str) -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let mut file = File::open(file_path).await?;
    let mut buffer = vec![0; 1024];
    let mut packet_number = 0;

    while let Ok(n) = file.read(&mut buffer).await {
        if n == 0 { break; }
        let packet = format!("{}|{}|", packet_number, n).into_bytes();
        socket.send_to(&[packet, buffer[..n].to_vec()].concat(), addr).await?;
        packet_number += 1;
    }
    Ok(())
}

async fn receive_file_udp(socket: UdpSocket, file_path: &str) -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let mut file = File::create(file_path).await?;
    let mut buffer = [0; 1048]; // Extra for packet meta

    loop {
        let (n, _addr) = socket.recv_from(&mut buffer).await?;
        let packet_info = String::from_utf8_lossy(&buffer[..n]);

        let parts: Vec<&str> = packet_info.split('|').collect();
        let packet_number: usize = parts[0].parse().unwrap();
        let data_size: usize = parts[1].parse().unwrap();

        if data_size == 0 { break; }
        file.write_all(&buffer[packet_number..packet_number + data_size]).await?;
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

## Error Handling

- **TCP**: Relies on the protocol's inherent reliability for error detection and correction.
- **UDP**:
  - **Acknowledgments**: Sender expects ACK for each packet; implements resend if no ACK.
  - **Checksums**: Pre-send error detection; requests retransmission if packet corrupt.
  
### Rust Safety

- Rust's ownership model prevents data corruption as each task safely handles its data.
- Concurrency issues like race conditions are avoided with the use of Rust's `tokio::sync` synchronization primitives.

## Performance Comparison

| Aspect               | TCP                              | UDP                              |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Transfer Speed       | Slower due to verification steps | Faster, minimal overhead         |
| Reliability          | High, inbuilt guarantees         | Needs manual handling            |
| Error Rate           | Low, automatic retries           | Potentially higher, user-managed |
| Use Case             | Critical data accuracy           | Speed and low latency            |

## Conclusion

By leveraging Rust's safety features and `tokio`'s async capabilities, the file transfer system ensures robust and efficient file handling. TCP is used for reliability-critical transfers, while UDP is selected where speed is more crucial, with custom reliability enhancements applied as needed. This balance ensures both high performance and data integrity in a Rust-based chat application.
