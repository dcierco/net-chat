# Network Performance Testing and Evaluation

## Test Setup

### Tools Used

- **Criterion.rs**: For benchmarking Rust code, measuring performance under different loads.
- **Network Simulators**: Tools like `tc` and `netem` for simulating various network conditions such as latency and packet loss.
- **Monitoring**: Custom scripts to log metrics like delivery time, throughput, and server load.

### Test Cases

1. **Low Latency Network**
   - Simulate ideal conditions with minimal delay (e.g., 10ms).

2. **High Latency Network**
   - Introduce significant delay (e.g., 150ms) to test performance under suboptimal conditions.

3. **Packet Loss Simulation**
   - Simulate packet loss rates of 5% and 10%.

## Metrics Measured

- **Delivery Time**: Time taken for a message or file to be fully delivered.
- **Throughput**: Number of messages/files successfully transferred per unit time.
- **Latency**: Time delay experienced in message delivery.
- **Server Load**: CPU and memory usage on the server during testing.

### Graphical Representation

```plaintext
Graphs would typically include:
1. Latency vs. Delivery Time chart
2. Throughput vs. Network Conditions graph
3. Server Load visual over time
```
*(Note: Actual graphs should be plotted using a tool like Matplotlib or Excel for detailed visual representation.)*

## Discussion

### Effects of Network Conditions

- **Low Latency**: Both protocols perform optimally, with UDP slightly faster due to lower overhead.
- **High Latency**: TCP’s inherent congestion control increases delivery times, but ensures reliability. UDP maintains speed but sees increased error rates.
- **Packet Loss**: TCP effectively manages packet retransmissions, maintaining lower error rates at the cost of speed. UDP requires custom handling to mitigate increased errors.

### Optimizations Based on Outcomes

1. **UDP Enhancements**:
   - Enhanced acknowledgment systems to reduce error rates under packet loss conditions.
   
2. **TCP Optimization**:
   - Adjusted buffer sizes and used `tokio::tasks` to better handle high latency scenarios.

3. **Load Management**:
   - Implemented server-side optimizations to reduce CPU usage, such as refining concurrency management and optimizing async tasks handling.

## Conclusion

The performance evaluation highlights the trade-offs between TCP’s reliability and UDP’s speed under different network conditions. By leveraging Rust’s async capabilities and ensuring robust error-handling mechanisms, the chat application manages to perform efficiently across varied network scenarios, offering important insights for further optimizations in future iterations.
